# Capybaras-Capstone-Project

## Thought process
There were some difficulties in choosing our topic. We initially wanted to do matrix multiplication optimization, but there was a lack of reliable information, so we decided to switch gears.

We decided to implement an edge detection algorithm using the Hadamard gate called QHED (Quantum Hadamard Edge Detection). Our implementation also included QPIE (Quantum Probability Image Encoding) as image preprocessing.  

## Implementation

07/28 - decided on topic and took notes; began implementing some helper functions and finding test images

07/29 - continued implementation
